                <p class="biopara">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's birthday 2021: Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India was born on October 15, 1931 and passed away on 27 July, 2015. He was an aerospace scientist and also played an instrumental role in the May 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests.

His involvement in Nuclear Power in India earned him the title "Missile Man of India". Due to his contribution, the government of India awarded him the highest civilian award. 
He was known as the Missile Man of India for his important role in the nation's civilian space programme and military missile development. Also, in 1998, he made significant contributions to India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests.

Do you know that A.P.J Abdul Kalam began his career as a scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO)? He had also served as the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) at ISRO.

“FAILURE will never overtake me if my definition to SUCCEED is strong enough”.

In the 1990s he had served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister before becoming the President of India in 2002. Now, let us study Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam in detail through this article.
Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October, 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram, then in Madras Presidency in British India and now in Tamil Nadu. His father's name was Jainulabdeen, who was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque. His mother's name was Ashiamma, who was a housewife.

Abdul Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest was a sister, namely Asim Zohra and three elder brothers, namely Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar, Mustafa Kalam and Kasim Mohammed. He was close to his family and always helps them, though he remained the bachelor his whole life.

His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. They trade groceries between the mainland and the island to and from Srilanka and also ferrying the pilgrims from the mainland to the Pamban Island. So, their family got the title "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers) and later known as "Marakier."

But by the 1920s, his family had lost most of his fortune; their businesses failed and by the time Abdul Kalam was born are in the stage of poverty-stricken. To help the family, Kalam started selling newspapers at an early age.
